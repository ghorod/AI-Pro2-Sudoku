Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so  that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes",  "blocks", or "regions") contain all the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid,  which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. For example, the (left) figure demonstrates a typical Sudoku  puzzle, and its solution (right).
